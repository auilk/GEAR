# GEAR

**GEAR** is a lightweight JavaScript library for high-performance 2D rendering, with 3D support planned for future releases. Built directly on top of WebGL, GEAR gives you full control over the GPU while offering a minimal, modern API for interactive web graphics.

## Goals
- Unified rendering pipeline for both 2D (now) and 3D (soon)
- Minimal, easy-to-learn API without sacrificing power
- Built directly on raw WebGL for precision and performance
- Modular architecture for maximum flexibility and extensibility
